## Code for Training Thinner and Deeper Neural Networks: Jumpstart Regularization

### Structure of the code

The code is divided in two parts: the experiments involving to the Moons and MNIST datasets are implemented in keras, and the ones involving CIFAR-10/100 are implemented in pytorch. The code for generating the charts and tables is also implemented in pytorch. See each folder's readme for instructions on how to run each of the experiments.
